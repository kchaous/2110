    /* Implementation notes:
     *
     * Wherever possible, prefer library functions to writing your own loops.
     *
     * The more complicated your loops become, the more important it is to explain
     * the logic in comments. We don't explain break and continue. We prefer that
     * you don't use them.
     *
     * When writing comments within a method body, you may find it useful to
     * use multi-line comments to describe WHAT the code doing, and single-line
     * comments to describe HOW it is doing it. For example:
     *
     *    /* Remove the unfrobnicatable whizbangs * /
     *    for (...)
     *        // NOTE: a whizbang is frobnicatable if it has two or more tails
     *        ...
     *
     *    /* Frobnicate all the remaining whizbangs * /
     *    for (...)
     *        ...
     */

    /* Notes on Java if statements and loops:
     *
     * Write an if statement like this:
     *
     *     if (boolean-expression) {
     *         do this if boolean-expression is true
     *     }
     *
     * Write an if-else statement like this:
     *
     *     if (boolean-expression) {
     *         do this if boolean-expression is true
     *     } else {
     *         do this if boolean-expression is false
     *     }
     *
     * Write a while-loop like this:
     *
     *    while ( boolean-expression ) {
     *        repetend (the loop body, "the thing to be repeated")
     *    }
     *
     * To execute the while-loop, do the following:
     *
     *   1. Evaluate the boolean-expression; if is is false, stop.
     *   2. Execute the repetend.
     *   3. Continue again at step 1.
     *
     * Write a for-loop to do-something several times, with i having values in
     * m..n-1 (i.e. with i being m, m+1, m+2, ..., n-1). 
     *
     *    for (int i= m; i < n; i= i+1) {
     *        repetend
     *    }
     *
     * The for-loop above is equivalent to the while-loop below, except that
     * local variable i is NOT usable after the loop; its scope is its assignment
     * together with the loop.
     *
     *    int i= m;
     *    while (i < n) {
     *        repetend
     *        i= i+1;
     *    }
